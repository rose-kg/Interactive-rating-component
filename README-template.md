## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- -JavaScript

### What I learned

In addition to CSS, I also learned several important concepts in JavaScript for enhancing the interactivity and functionality of the website:

1. Event Listeners: I gained a better understanding of how to use event listeners to detect and respond to user interactions, such as clicks or touches, and trigger specific actions in the webpage.

```JS
element.addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Handle click event
});
```
2. Iterating Over Elements: You're using forEach to iterate over each <li> element within the .numbers class and adding a click event listener to each one

 ```JS
 numbers.forEach(function(number) {
    // Event listener for each number
});
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to continue focusing on the following areas:
-Advanced JavaScript Concepts: I want to deepen my understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts such as asynchronous programming, closures, and prototypal inheritance. Mastering these concepts will enable me to write more efficient and maintainable JavaScript code.
-Responsive Design: I plan to delve deeper into responsive design principles and techniques, including fluid layouts, media queries, and mobile-first development. This will help me create websites that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
